This file lists the various contributors to the project.  Anyone listed here
remains the copyright holder of their contributions, and is listed here to
acknowledge their work.

Both individuals and organizations may be listed here.  Either way, we require

abbreviations.  We also ask to include all the EMail addresses used to commit
patches, each within angle brackets.

If you are a contributor and would like to be removed from this list, please
contact the project maintainers.

When adding a new entry, please keep the list sorted by the first name, this
may be easily achieved using the sort command on UNIX systems.

For illustration:

John Doe <john@doe.com>
Acme Corporation <usr1@ac.me> <usr2@ac.me>
